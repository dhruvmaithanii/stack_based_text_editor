# stack_based_text_editor
This Python program implements a simple stack-based text editor that allows users to perform basic text editing operations like inserting characters, deleting characters, undoing, and redoing actions. The editor uses two stacks (undo_stack and redo_stack) to manage the history of changes, enabling undo and redo functionality.
